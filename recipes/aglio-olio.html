    <h3>About Aglio Olio</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a simple Italian dish of garlic, 
        olive oil, parsley, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese tossed 
        with cooked pasta.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1lb Dried Spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>8 Garlic Cloves cut into thin slivers</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Minced Fresh Parsley</li>
        <li>1 Cup Freshly Grated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>---</p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. 
            Add 2 tablespoons of salt and the pasta <br>and cook 
            according to the directions on the package. 
            Set aside 1 & 1/2 <br>cups of the pasta cooking water before 
            you drain the pasta.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium 
            heat in a pot large enough to hold the pasta, <br>
            such as a 12-inch saute pan or a large, shallow pot. 
            Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring <br>
            frequently, until it just begins to turn golden on 
            the edges-don't overcook it! Add the red pepper flakes <br>
            and cook for 30 seconds more. Carefully add the 
            reserved pasta-cooking water to the garlic and oil <br>
            and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, add 1 teaspoon 
            of salt, and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the <br>
            liquid is reduced by about a third.</li><br>
        <li>Add the drained pasta to the garlic sauce and toss. 
            Off the heat, add the parsley and Parmesan <br>and toss well.
            Allow the pasta to rest off the heat for 5 minutes for 
            the sauce to be absorbed. <br>Taste for seasoning and serve 
            warm with extra Parmesan on the side.</li>
    </ol>
